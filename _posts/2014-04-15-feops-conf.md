I'll be in San Francisco next week for [Front End Ops Conf 2014](http://www.feopsconf.com/).  It's got a really good line-up of speakers and I'm excited to go learn some new strategies and tools for testing, automation and deployment of front end applications.

I'm going to try to blog my conference notes and any useful tools/links during the conference here.
